Human Benchmark Project Thomas Hynes

The main class in the entry point for the Project

To use this project, first run then type your username into the box and press the enter key. When the menu appears after you submit your username, you can select from the given games.

The Reaction Time Test is finished, once you press the start button you will see the red screen telling you to wait for the next green screen, once you press the green screen you will see your scores in milliseconds. If this is your highest score for the session it will set it as your highscore for the game the game can be replayed as many times as you wish.

The Sequence Memory Game is finished, once you press the start button you will be shown the first square that you must remember, you must click the correct squares in the correct order and if you do not you will recieve a game over. This game will also save your highest score after you fail a round.

The Ain Trainer Game is finished, once you press the start button you will see an initial target to click you will click the targets until you have clicked all 30, once that has been done the game will tell you your average time per target in milliseconds and this score will be saved if it is a highscore. 

The Number Memory Game is finished, once you press the start button you will be shown a number you must enter this number into the box shown, if you enter this number correctly a larger number will be shown next and you will be given slightly more time to remember this next number. This will continue until you incorrectly enter a number. When that is the case your highscore for the game will be updated if it is a new highscore and the game will end.

The Verbal Memory Game is finished, once you press the start button you will be shown your first word, if you press new you will increase your score by one if not, you will lose a life. After this first word you will get more words and you must determine if youve already seen this word before, or if it is a new word. once you lose all three lives for three mistakes, your highscore will be updated if its a new highscore and the game will end.

I was not able to complete Chimp Test, Visual Memory, or Typing. When starting this game the screen will turn to null and you can go back and select another game.

The back button will take you back to the main menu and appears while playing any of the games.

The reset button will allow the user to go back to the start of the game to start again.

When you are finished playing the games, if you want to save your highscores to the scores.csv file then select the 'Get Scoers and Quit' button at the bottom of the main menu. If there is already a scores.csv file in the resources folder, it will append the line containing the current session username and highscores to that file. If the file does not exist, it will create a scores.csv file and add a top row with column names and a first row with your game stats.
